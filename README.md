# ODonnell-Orbit-Watch

Orbit is a smartwatch designed specifically to help children and adults with ADHD manage their time and tasks effectively. The watch works through a series of customizable, parent-programmed alerts and reminders that help guide users through their daily routines. This software would be accessible via a companion mobile app, where users or caregivers can set up schedules, assign tasks, and configure reminders in a way that best suits their needs.

## About the Project
Orbit Watch works through customizable, caregiver or user-set, reminders, timers, and reinforcement to guide ADHD users through structured routines. Visual and tactile cues reduce dependence on sound-based alerts and create a low-disruption experience, especially in classroom or work settings. 

## Intended functions

- **Customizable Alerts & Reminders:**
  - Users can schedule task reminders, such as homework time, brushing teeth, or getting ready for school, through a mobile app. 

- **Vibrational & Visual Cues:**
  - Instead of relying on sound-based notifications (which can be distracting in class or work), the watch uses vibrations and visual cues to notify the user. 

- **Routine Management:**
  - Create detailed schedules, including morning and evening routines, with specific timed blocks for each task (e.g., Wake Up, Eat, Brush Teeth, Get   Dressed, etc.). 

- **Persistent Reminders:**
  - Tasks remain on the watch until marked complete, helping users stay accountable. 

- **Countdown Warnings:**
  - Users receive transition warnings at intervals (e.g., 15, 10, 5, and 1 minute) before the next scheduled task begins. 

- **Task Timers:**
  - Includes general timers, Pomodoro-style timers, and programmable task timers (e.g., Clean Room – 15 minutes, Daily Reading – 30 minutes). 

- **Positive Reinforcement System:**
  - Tracks behaviors such as completing tasks and meeting weekly goals, rewarding users with encouragement or parent-set rewards. 

- **AI Task Breakdown:**
  - AI helps break down complex tasks into simple, timed steps, making large tasks more manageable. 

- **Emergency Notifications:**
  - Quick-call or message alerts to caregivers in case the user needs assistance.

- **Offline Mode:**
  - Works without requiring a constant internet connection, reducing distractions and increasing reliability.
